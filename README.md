# Linear_Regression
Objective:

Your task is to build an interactive application that utilizes Linear Regression for predicting adependent variable based on a dataset of your choice. The application should include:
1. Problem Selection – Choose an interesting real-world or hypothetical problem whereLinear Regression applies.
2. Dataset Selection – Obtain a relevant dataset from Kaggle or generate synthetic data usingChatGPT.
3. Model Training & Prediction – Train a Linear Regression model and use it forpredictions.
4. User Interface (UI) Development – Build a UI to take user input for the independent
variable(s) and display the predicted output.

Steps:

1. Choose a Problem
    Select a real-world application where predicting a continuous variable makes sense.
    Example ideas:
    1. Predicting house prices based on features like size, number of bedrooms,
    and location.
    2. Estimating a student's final grade based on hours studied and attendance.
    3. Forecasting car fuel efficiency based on weight, horsepower, and enginesize.
    4. Predicting the salary of an individual based on years of experience andeducation level.
    5. Estimating the price of a used smartphone based on specifications and age.

2. Select or Generate a Dataset
    1. Find a suitable dataset from Kaggle. Examples:
    1. House Prices: Kaggle - House Price Prediction
    2. Student Performance: Kaggle - Student Scores
    3. Car Fuel Efficiency: Kaggle - MPG dataset
    2. If you can’t find a dataset, use ChatGPT to generate synthetic data (e.g., ask:
    “Generate a CSV file with 500 rows of car features and fuel efficiency values”).

3. Train a Linear Regression Model
Use Python with sklearn to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate performance

4. Build a User Interface
Create a simple web-based UI using Flask + HTML/CSS, Streamlit, or Gradio.
